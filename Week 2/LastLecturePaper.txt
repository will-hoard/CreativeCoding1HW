Randy Pausch's “Last Lecture” was incredibly touching and resonated with me a lot. My own father passed away from cancer at a fairly young age, so, truth be told, stories like this always hit a little too close to home. That being said, everything he mentions in the video resonates with me, especially his reminder to live life without regrets and focus on what you can control. Life is too short to worry about the stuff you can’t control, and it’s also too short to give up on yourself and live a life that isn’t what you want. Having lived through the experience of seeing someone I love go through something similar to Pausch’s struggle, I understand the importance of focusing on what truly matters and making the most of life. I feel I do a pretty good job of reminding myself to live with no regrets. That being said, I am human. The trials and tribulations of everyday life can really dilute his message, so it’s always nice to have a reminder or another example of someone who really lived through a similar experience to my dad.

If I’m being honest, this coding class scares me a little. I have dabbled in coding, but I have always seemed to hit a wall when I have tried to learn on my own. I’m ready to move beyond that wall, though, and really take in the information I learn in this class. One thing that I think I am bad at, and that I think Randy’s lecture touches on, is not being so hard on yourself or placing too much pressure on your tasks. I am notoriously bad at that, but since this class isn’t for a degree or anything, I am trying to remove some of the pressure and allow myself to have fun with any challenges that come up while learning to code.
