I’m not sure I’m convinced that learning styles affect how we learn. 
I think everyone has a preference for how they learn, but that isn’t the way one must learn, nor is it the only way one can be successful. 
It goes back to the fixed mindset—I think most of us, from a young age, are taught that there is only one way to do something, and if you can’t do it that way, then you aren’t doing it correctly. 
I know I have always struggled with this. I remember in high school working on a weekly statistics question in front of the class (I wasn’t very good at statistics, but I figured out the question on my own and was super excited to explain it to the class). A
fter I finished the question, my teacher and the class all acted so confused about how I got the answer. 
I remember my teacher, before saying anything, paused, tilted her head, and then said, “Huh.” 
From there, she said, “You got the question right, but I have no idea how you got there.” 
I remember being so frustrated that, despite being so excited I got the answer correct, no one understood how I got there.
Often, when I was growing up and learning, this seemed to be my experience—where I learned something but in a totally different way from what was expected of me.

Fast forward to my college days, when one of my best friends I met grew up attending Montessori schools his whole life. 
When I say he was the best problem solver I’ve ever met, it’s true.
He never seemed to stress or worry too much about figuring out a problem.
I asked him about this one day, and he credited it to his schooling and having the ability to learn on his own terms without being criticized for it.

This makes me think about how much room there is for growth in our educational systems when it comes to how we approach learning styles. 
What works for one person might not work for someone else, but that doesn’t mean either method is wrong. 
Instead, it’s important to allow for a variety of approaches to learning, even if they don’t match the traditional expectations. 
Learning styles, for me, seem more about creating a space where people feel free to explore, make mistakes, and find their own path, rather than trying to fit into a mold that doesn’t suit them.
