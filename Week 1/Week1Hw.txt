Both CLI and GUI are ways we can interact with operating systems. 
However, while CLI (command-line interface) takes commands via text in a terminal or console, GUI (graphical user interface) 
relies on graphics and visual elements that users interact with on their computer. 
These graphics include widgets and icons created by app developers, allowing users to navigate their operating system easily. Think a Google icon or the GitHub desktop icon.
GUIs have a relatively low level of difficulty for users but are limited to the predefined commands given to them by their developers.

CLIs, on the other hand, provide users with much more freedom and flexibility to interact with their operating systems. 
Users who use CLI can access different applications and code specific commands through text commands. 
They give users much more ability to customize and edit their experiences within their operating systems. 
However, because of this, they require more knowledge of syntax and coding languages. 
Coders often use CLIs to access their operating system and write new applications.
It's also curcial that anyone who wishes to code understands CLI.
While GUIs are great for beginners, CLIs are preferred by advanced coders for complex tasks that might not be available to do through a GUI.
