Final Project Proposal: "Bug Escape"
Key Features:
Player Control: The bug will be controlled via keyboard (arrow keys) or mouse movement.
Obstacles: Randomly generated hazards that the bug must avoid.
Scoring System: Points increase the longer the bug survives; collisions end the game.
Background Music & Sound Effects: A looping soundtrack and sound effects for collisions/pickups.
Visual Style: Digitally designed assets/photoshop or images sources online (bug sprite, obstacles, background).

Inspiration: 
"Dig Dug" (Namco, 1982) – Classic enemy-dodging mechanics (like avoiding obstacles in Bug Escape). 
"Centipede" (Atari, 1981) – Top-down insect-themed shooter/insect movement 

Technical Challenges & New Skills
Collision Detection: Need to learn how to implement hitboxes between the bug and obstacles.
Sprite Animation: If I want the bug to have animated wings, I’ll need to research frame-by-frame animation.
Sound Integration: Loading and triggering sound effects/music.
Difficulty Scaling: Increasing obstacle speed over time.

Work Plan & Deadlines
Week 1 (April 28th – May 2nd): 
- Concept finalization + asset prep
- GitHub repo + p5.js setup	
- Bug movement (keyboard/mouse)	
- Obstacle spawn (falling raindrops)	
- Collision detection	
- Scoring system + game over screen	

Week 2 (May 3rd- May 8th):
- Background music + UI polish
- Try to Animate wings (if time allows)
- Playtesting + fixes
- Polish and tweak 
- Submit
